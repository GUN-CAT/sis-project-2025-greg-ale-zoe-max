Add your reflection towards the end of the project by interviewing group members.
Zoe(me): I really enjoyed the project, it was something new i have never done before and i really enjoyed learning how to code a web site. It was a really intresting process and i would like to do something like that again. I learned how to add pictures and was also able to show it to other groups and im really proud of that
gergory(Infrastructure): the communication was really good, everybody knew what everybody was doing. The main challange was figurung out github and how we could commit changes.the biggest challange was figuring out how to add links into html. If he could go back he would explain the commiting process to everyone at the same time. 
Allesandro: i did my tasks exactly as we dicussed. he learned no new skills, he just learned about html. There were no problems during the project.
Max: was to prove read the text, and make sure everybody does theyr work and make sure what everyone is doing. The communiaction was good structured.
Overall we all enjoyed the project and worked really good as a group, the communication was flawless and everyone knew what exactly they have to do, we did have some problems at the begining because we didnt know how the website works and the commiting changes, but we pretty fast learned how to do it.
