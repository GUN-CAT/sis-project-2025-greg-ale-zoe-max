We decided to make  monkey rental website. It was decided that everyone is happy in they roles in the group.
The 'Aufgabenverteilung' was problemless, and everyone agreed with their given task
Zoe and Alessandro are going to write about the monkey available for rent, Gregory would write the overview for the website, 
and Max is creating the rules, prices and regulations for the monkeys that will be rented.
