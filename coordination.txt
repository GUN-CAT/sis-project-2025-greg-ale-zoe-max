We decided to make monkey rental website, as per Zoe's request, which accords with her role as innovation. Everyone agreed with her suggestion.
Everyone is happy in their roles in the group, so it stayed the same.
The 'Aufgabenverteilung' followed a little discussion,but in the end everyone agreed with their given task:
Zoe and Alessandro are going to write about the monkey available for rent,
Gregory would write the overview for the website, 
and Max would create the rules, prices and regulations for the monkeys that will be rented.
