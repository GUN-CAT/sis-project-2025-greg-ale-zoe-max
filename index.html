    <h1>Finger Monkeys:</h1>
    <p>The finger monkey, also known as the pygmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea), is the world’s smallest monkey. Native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru, these tiny primates thrive in dense forests near rivers. They typically grow to about 12–15 cm (4.7–6 inches) in body length, with an additional 15–20 cm (6–8 inches) tail. Despite their small size, they are highly agile, using their sharp claws to cling to tree trunks and feed on tree sap, insects, and fruits. Weighing only 100–140 grams (3.5–5 ounces), finger monkeys are social creatures that live in groups and communicate through high-pitched calls.</p>
