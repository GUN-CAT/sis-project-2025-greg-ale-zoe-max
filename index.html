    <h2>Our monkeys:</h2>


    <h1>Finger Monkeys:</h1>
    <p>The finger monkey, also known as the pygmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea), is the world’s smallest monkey. Native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru, these tiny primates thrive in dense forests near rivers. They typically grow to about 12–15 cm (4.7–6 inches) in body length, with an additional 15–20 cm (6–8 inches) tail. Despite their small size, they are highly agile, using their sharp claws to cling to tree trunks and feed on tree sap, insects, and fruits. Weighing only 100–140 grams (3.5–5 ounces), finger monkeys are social creatures that live in groups and communicate through high-pitched calls.</p>
<h1>Squirrel Monkey</h1>
    <p> Squirrel monkeys are small, energetic primates with bright yellow fur and playful personalities. Native to Central and South America, they love to interact with people and explore their surroundings. Perfect for events, photoshoots, or just adding a fun twist, these curious monkeys will steal the show!</p>
<h2>The Macaque:</h2>
    <p>A macaque monkey is an intelligent, social, and highly active primate known for its playful nature and expressive face. These curious creatures are quick learners and can form strong bonds with their owners. Renting a macaque as a pet offers a unique experience of interacting with a highly engaging and entertaining animal. However, they require specialized care, attention, and enrichment to stay happy and healthy. Perfect for those seeking a temporary, lively companion with a mischievous charm! </p>
